=== Rules ===
* Last set is As Many Reps As Possible (AMRAP)
* Progress with 2.5lbs for upper body, 5lbs for lower body
* If final AMRAP set hits 10+ reps, double your weight increase
* Any barbell row variant will do, but Phrakture is partial to Yates Rows
* Feel free to use Power Cleans to warmup for Deadlifts
* Chinups are palms facing you, approximately shoulder width grip – begin unweighted, adding weight in 2.5lbs increments
* If you cannot do 3×5 chinups, do negatives until you can
* If you fail to make 5 reps in the FINAL SET, deload by 10%
